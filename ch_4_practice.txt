## 1. What is []?

[] is an empty list.


## 2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam[2] = 'hello'


For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
## 3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?

'd'


## 4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

'd'


## 5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

['a','b']


For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
## 6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

1


## 7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


## 8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]


## 9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

Operator for list concatentation: +
Operator for list replication: *


## 10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

append() adds the value to the end of the list.
insert() adds the value at the index specified.


## 11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

The remove() method and the del statement can be used to remove values from a list.


## 12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

lists and strings can both be indexed, sliced, used in for loops, and used with in and not in, be used with len(), and be concatentated and replicated


## 13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.
lists are defined with square brackets, [], while tuples are defined with parentheses ()


## 14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

(42,)


## 15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

The tuple() function can be used to get a tuple from a list.
The list() function can be used to get a list from a tuple.


## 16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

Variables contain references to list values.


## 17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy() creates a copy of a list. If the list itself contains lists, copy.deepcopy() will also copy the inner lists.
